abstract="The design and manufacturing of modern medical devices requires knowledge of several disciplines, ranging from physics, over material science, to computer science. Thus, designing a single lecture as an introduction to medical engineering faces a lot of challenges. Nonetheless, the manuscript Medical Imaging Systems -- An Introductory Guide aims at being a complete and comprehensive introduction to this field for students in the early semesters. Medical imaging devices are by now an integral part of modern medicine, and have probably already been encountered by all students in their personal life.",
