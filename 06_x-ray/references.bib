abstract="In this chapter, the physical principles of X-rays are introduced. We start with a general definition of X-rays compared to other well known rays, e.Â g., the visible light. In Sec. 7.2, we will learn how X-rays can be generated and how they can be characterized with respect to their energy. The most relevant concept to understand how X-ray imaging works is the behavior of X-rays when they interact with matter.",
